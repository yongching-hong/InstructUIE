The first dock was opened in 1889 and, as work continued northward, the second one was opened in 1890. The Panic of 1890, however, led to the suspension of works, a setback remedied by a congressional appropriation in 1892.

Cetshwayo was wounded but escaped to Nkandla, KwaZulu-Natal forest. After pleas from the Resident Commissioner, Sir Melmoth Osborne, the king moved to Eshowe, KwaZulu-Natal where he died a few months later, presumably from a heart attack, though possibly he was poisoned. His body was buried within sight of the forest, to the south near Nkunzane River.

Ross began her novel Oreo hoping for a career in writing, and it was published in 1974 at the height of the Black Power movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Ross wrote articles for magazines such as Essence, Titters and Playboy, and then got work on The Richard Pryor Show. She was unable to complete a second novel, due to difficulties supporting herself on this work. She worked in media and publishing until she died on September 17, 1985 in New York City.",

He was the son of James and Elizabeth (nee Lawler) Fitzpatrick and born in the Headfort Arms Hotel, Virginia where his parents were the proprietors. From a privileged upbringing Thomas was educated at St. Patrick's, Carlow College, a school well noted for turning out many fine Catholic theologians. However his university education at Trinity College, Dublin enabled him to distinguish himself in medicine where he qualified with a BA in 1853, MA in 1854, MB and MD by 1856. During this time Thomas Fitzpatrick also practiced as a doctor in the Co. Cavan village of Mullagh before entering service during 1856 with the British East India Company as an assistant surgeon, an experience which was to leave a lasting impression on him, through his future attitudes towards primitive medicine, magic and religion.",

His father seems to have migrated to Manchester while Cornelius Bayley was young, and to have been a leather-breeches-maker there. Bayley was educated at the Whitchurch Grammar School, Shropshire, of which for a short time he acted as master. He became a methodist preacher, but afterwards took holy orders, and was the first incumbent of St. James's Church, Manchester, a ''proprietary church,`` which he built in 1787. The degree of B.D. was conferred on him at Cambridge in 1792, and that of D.D. in 1800. In 1782 he published his Hebrew grammar, entitled ''An Entrance into the Sacred Tongue. `` A second edition was issued after his death. He wrote notes and a preface to an edition of the ''Homilies`` of the church, published at Manchester in 1811. His other published writings were sermons and pamphlets, one being on the ''Swedenborgian Doctrine of the Trinity`` (1785). He died on 2 April 1812 at Manchester.",

Bock was one of the most highly skilled of the early convict artists.

Chief Cahill was totally blindsided by Mayor Alioto's move. Alioto felt Cahill was too ``rigid'' and ``old fashioned'' for law enforcement in 1970s San Francisco. This was indeed a shame, as Cahill loved, lived, and breathed the SFPD. While Al Nelder was a good chief and an honorable man, he was not the iconic figure that Tom Cahill was. After Chief Cahill's termination he became Chief of Security for Pac Bell in San Francisco and eventually retired. He died October 12, 2002 in Lake County at Queen of the Valley Hospital in Clearlake Park, California. He was survived by four children and many grandchildren.

Willstatter helped his somewhat impecunious American student by sharing the cost of laboratory supplies with him, arranging that when expensive materials, such as silver nitrate, were to be bought, it was his turn to pay, while Heidelberger took turns buying cheaper materials like sulfuric acid. ``Better training than that you couldn't have,'' Heidelberger summed up his experience with Willstatter. They remained friends for three decades, through Willstatter's flight from Germany in 1938 and until his death in Switzerland in 1942.",

The challenge for the competition was to create a facade which brought together two periods in architecture: the Gothic style, which had faded out, and the Renaissance style, which was more recent. In 1871, Fabris' design won, and he immediately went to work embellishing the cathedral with red, green, and white marble. Florence was extremely proud of De Fabris' devotion of his time and energy to make this a truly monumental landmark of the city. Fabris died in 1883.",

This musical family, which includes two older brothers, Marius and Alexander, moved in 1972 to Groenlo, where Peter received his first piano lessons at the age of six. Although originally both parents did not associate the word ``musician'' with the word ``career'', music is definitely in the family's blood. Both Marius (1966) and Alexander (1968) become professionals on string bass and tenor saxophone, respectively. After college, Peter studied from 1989 at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague . He combined his music studies with law school, but the jazz virus matured and he decided to concentrate exclusively on music.",
